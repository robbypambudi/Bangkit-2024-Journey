# AK Navigation the Google Cloud 

## Use Case of Cloud Computing

- **Infrstructure Scaling** - The ability to scale infrastructure up or down based on demand.
- **Application Development** - The ability to develop and deploy applications quickly and easily.
- **Disaster Recovery** - The ability to recover from a disaster quickly and easily.
- **Data Storage** - The ability to store data in a secure and reliable manner.
  - Example: Google Cloud Storage is a fully managed, scalable, and secure object storage service.
  - Example: Google Cloud SQL is a fully managed relational database service for MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQL Server.
- **Big Data Analytics** - The ability to analyze large amounts of data quickly and easily.
  - Example: Google BigQuery is a fully managed data warehouse that enables you to run fast, SQL-like queries against multi-terabyte datasets in seconds.

## Benefits of Cloud Computing

- **Cost savings** - Cloud computing eliminates the need for upfront investments in hardware and software, and reduces the cost of maintaining and managing that hardware and software.
  - Ex: Google Cloud Platform offers a pay-as-you-go pricing model, which means you only pay for what you use.
  - Ex: Google Cloud Platform offers sustained use discounts, which means you automatically get discounted prices for long-running workloads.
- **Scalability** - Cloud computing allows you to scale up or down based on demand, and to do so quickly and easily.
  - Ex: Google Cloud Platform offers autoscaling, which means you can automatically add or remove instances based on demand.
- **Security** - Cloud computing providers offer a wide range of security features and tools to help protect your data and applications.
  - Ex: Google Cloud Platform offers encryption at rest and in transit, and provides a wide range of security features and tools to help protect your data and applications.
- **Reliability** - Cloud computing providers offer a high level of reliability, with built-in redundancy and failover capabilities.
  - Ex: Google Cloud Platform offers a 99.95% uptime SLA for its compute engine service, and provides a wide range of reliability features and tools to help ensure that your applications are always available.

## Characteristics of Cloud Computing

- **On-demand self-service** - Cloud computing resources can be provisioned and de-provisioned on demand, without human intervention.
- **Broad network access** - Cloud computing resources can be accessed over the network from a wide range of devices, such as PCs, laptops, tablets, and smartphones.
- **Resource pooling** - Cloud computing resources are pooled together to serve multiple consumers, with different physical and virtual resources dynamically assigned and reassigned according to demand.
- **Rapid elasticity** - Cloud computing resources can be rapidly and elastically provisioned and de-provisioned to quickly scale up and down based on demand.
- **Measured service** - Cloud computing resources are metered and measured, so you only pay for what you use.

## Service Models of Cloud Computing

- **Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)** - Provides virtualized computing resources over the internet.
- **Platform as a Service** - Provides a platform that allows customers to develop, run, and manage applications without the complexity of building and maintaining the infrastructure.
- **Software as a Service** - Provides software applications over the internet on a subscription basis.

## Exploring Google Cloud's Region

- **Region** - A specific geographical location where you can host your resources.
- **Network** - A collection of resources that are connected to each other.

> Google Carbon Footprint - Google Cloud is carbon-neutral, which means that it has a net-zero carbon footprint.
