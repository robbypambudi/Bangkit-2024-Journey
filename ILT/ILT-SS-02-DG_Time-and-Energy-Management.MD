## The Foundamental of Time and Energy Menagement

### Why is managing time and energy important?

Jawaban: Karena waktu dan energi adalah sumber daya yang terbatas, dan kita harus mengelola sumber daya tersebut dengan baik agar dapat mencapai tujuan yang diinginkan.

### Busy vs Productive

Being busy is not the same as being productive. Being busy means that you are doing a lot of things, but it doesn't mean that you are doing the right things. Being productive means that you are doing the right things, and you are doing them well.
